# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is designed to have you practice  using selection (if-else statements), using user keyboard input, and displaying images.

When the user presses 'r', 'p' or 's', the program should switch to the appropriate rock, paper, or scissors image. 

The program should also generate a random value for the computer choice, and switch the computer to that image.

Finally, the program needs to use selection (conditional statements) to determine the winner and display an appropriate response at the bottom of the screen.

For extra credit, you can add a score tracker to keep track of wins, ties and losses. You could also expand the program to cover Rock Paper Scissors Lizzard Spock.
